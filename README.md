## Ethan Brown, Aspiring Data Analyst

- I'm a rising junior at Rutgers University, double majoring in Economics and Data Science. Through a curriculum based in programming, statistics, and economic theory, Iâ€™ve developed proficiency in data analysis and visualization along with a **strong** technical foundation in languages including Python, R, SQL, and Stata. ðŸŽ“

A rigorous dual enrollment program enabled me to earn my Associate's degree at the age of 17, instilling strong skills early in time management, adaptability, and discipline.

- As a classically-trained concert pianist, I bring a deep sensitivity to structure, detail, and pattern recognition, which I've carried into applied work in predictive modeling, algorithmic auditing, and economic research. ðŸŽ¹

Iâ€™m passionate about utilizing data to solve complex across fields including data science, financial analysis, and business intelligence. I'm currently looking for opportunities to continue developing these skills in fast-paced, real-world environments. Feel free to reach out through my contacts to the left!

- Recent projects: Machine Learning/Predictive Modeling (scikit-learn, imblearn), Feature Engineering, Cross-Validation, Exploratory Data Analysis ðŸ“š
