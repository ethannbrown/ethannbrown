## Ethan Brown, Aspiring Data Analyst

- I'm a rising junior at Rutgers University, double majoring in Economics and Data Science. Through a curriculum based in programming, statistics, and economic theory, I’ve developed proficiency in data analysis and visualization along with a **strong** technical foundation in languages including Python, R, SQL, and Stata.

- A rigorous dual enrollment program enabled me to earn my Associate's degree _at the age of 17_, instilling strong skills early in time management, adaptability, and discipline.

- As a classically-trained concert pianist, I bring a deep sensitivity to structure, detail, and pattern recognition, which I've carried into applied work in predictive modeling, algorithmic auditing, and economic research.

- I’m passionate about utilizing data to solve complex across fields including data science, financial analysis, and business intelligence. I'm currently looking for opportunities to continue developing these skills in fast-paced, real-world environments. Feel free to reach out through my contacts to the left!

- <ins>Recent</ins>: Machine learning in Python (scikit-learn, imblearn). Classification modeling (LR, RF, k-NN, XGB), feature engineering and grid search tuning for music popularity prediction. Addressed class imbalance (SMOTE) and assessed feature importance for optimization. Improved accuracy from ~30% to 86%; includes exploratory data analysis and data visualization (seaborn, mlxtend).
